# dbt-Snowflake Project 


# Introduction
This project is a comprehensive data engineering pipeline focused on analyzing Airbnb data to derive meaningful insights about listings, hosts, and user reviews. The primary objective is to build a robust and scalable data infrastructure that can ingest raw data, perform transformations, and facilitate advanced analytics and reporting.


# Project Overview
- **Data Sources**: Raw datasets including Airbnb listings, hosts, and reviews are sourced from CSV files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake is used as the cloud-based data warehouse for storing and querying large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Data Transformation**: dbt is employed to model, cleanse, and transform the raw data into analytics-ready tables.
- **Orchestration**: Dagster orchestrates the data pipelines, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order and at scheduled intervals.
- **Data Testing**: Rigorous data quality tests are implemented using dbt and custom SQL to ensure data integrity.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation is maintained using dbt's built-in documentation features and Markdown files.
- Visualization: Analytical dashboards are created (e.g., using Preset) to visualize key metrics and trends in the data.

- **Snowflake**: Utilized for its powerful cloud-based data warehousing capabilities, allowing for scalable storage and rapid querying.
- **dbt**: Used for data transformation and modeling. dbt enables modular SQL development with Jinja templating, facilitating reusable and maintainable code.
- **Dagster**: A data orchestrator that schedules and monitors the data pipelines, ensuring reliable and repeatable data workflows.
- **Jinja**: A templating language integrated with dbt to create dynamic SQL queries and macros, enhancing code flexibility.
- **SQL**: The primary language for querying, transforming, and testing data within the project.
- **Python**: Used for scripting, setting up virtual environments, and integrating with tools like dbt and Dagster.
- **Virtualenv**: Helps in creating isolated Python environments to manage project dependencies without conflicts.


# Key Objectives Achieved
- **Data Ingestion**: Successfully loaded raw Airbnb data into Snowflake from S3, setting up the foundational layer for analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: Developed source, staging, and dimensional models in dbt to structure the data appropriately for analytical purposes.
- **Incremental Loading**: Implemented incremental models in dbt to efficiently handle large datasets and updates over time.
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Established a suite of tests (both generic and custom) to validate data correctness and consistency.
- **Snapshots**: Created snapshots of key tables to track historical changes and support time-based analyses.
- **Orchestration and Scheduling**: Configured Dagster to manage pipeline execution, enhancing automation and reliability.
- **Documentation and Exposure**: Leveraged dbt's documentation features to create accessible project documentation and defined exposures for downstream dependencies like dashboards.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Generated analyses and visualizations to uncover insights, such as the impact of full moon dates on review sentiments.



# Benefits of the Project
- **Scalability**: By using Snowflake and dbt, the project can handle large datasets and complex transformations with ease.
- **Maintainability**: Modular code and templating reduce redundancy and make the project easier to maintain and extend.
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive testing ensures that data remains accurate and reliable throughout the pipeline.
- **Automation**: Orchestration with Dagster automates the data workflows, reducing manual intervention and the potential for errors.
- **Insight Generation**: The final datasets and visualizations provide valuable insights that can inform business decisions.
